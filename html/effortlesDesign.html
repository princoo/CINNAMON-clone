          A robust filtering system has been implemented to aid in the
          decision-making process, but in order for users to use it, it must
          look simple. We chose sliders and checkboxes over text fields for
          value input since they require less strain, especially on smaller
          screens. However, giving the option to type-in values if preferred.
