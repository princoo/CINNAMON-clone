          The results are presented in a way that makes the userâ€™s decision as
          easy as possible. To avoid overwhelming the user with options, only a
          few recommended offers are displayed on the first load. But, not to be
          limited, the user can switch between the offers and utilize a powerful
          filtering system to identify the one they are looking for.
