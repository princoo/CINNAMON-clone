          The user's dashboard is a tiled display of Fiona's different
          functions. Its core purpose is to provide users a place to keep track
          of recent loan queries and complete those that are still in progress,
          but for first-time users, the dashboard defaults to colorful
          empty-state cards that suggest useful actions that can be made.
